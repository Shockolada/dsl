      <h3>Project design</h3>
      <p>Interior design is the art and science of enhancing the interior of a building to achieve a healthier and
        more aesthetically pleasing environment for the people using the space.
        An interior designer is someone who plans, researches, coordinates, and manages such projects. Interior design
        is a multifaceted profession that includes. Project design is an early
        phase of the project where a project's key features, structure, criteria for success, and major deliverables
        are all planned out. The point is to develop one or more designs which can
        be used to achieve the desired project goals.Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
        text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
        it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up
        one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
        Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
        source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de
        Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
        treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. </p>
